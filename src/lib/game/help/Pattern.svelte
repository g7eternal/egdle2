  You start with three ðŸ’š hearts. If you make a mistake, the round is restarted - and you lose a
  heart.
  <br />
  Your goal is to survive for as long as possible. If you run out of hearts, the game ends.

  Rounds will get increasingly harder as you progress. The amount of eggs in your pattern will grow,
  and the pattern demonstration time will shorten.
