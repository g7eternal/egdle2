<p>
  You start with one egg in a top left corner.
  <br />
  Your goal in this game is to fill the field with eggs.

<p>
  Each cell has a different color. You can use the color palette to change colors of your cells.
  Whenever you do that, any cell that matches chosen color - and is adjacent to a cell with egg - is
  filled with another egg.
</p>

<p>
  Each run is evaluated by two criterias: how fast and how efficient you managed to fill the field.
  You can try to speedrun the game by using less time and clicking faster, or take more time - but
  solve the game in less clicks.

  If you are having a hard time distinguishing between cells of similar colors, try enabling the
  <strong>✴️&nbsp;Visual aid mode</strong>.
